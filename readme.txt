In order to use Tech Personal Assistant you have to use Pyhton 3.6 and install the following librabries:

pip3 install pyaudio
pip3 install SpeechRecognition
pip3 install pyttsx3
pip3 install wikipedia
pip3 install 

The Voice Assistant can be started by executing the main.py file.

We recommend using a headset / microphone. Due to the open-source offline-based speech recognition library pyttsx3, command processing might take some seconds.
